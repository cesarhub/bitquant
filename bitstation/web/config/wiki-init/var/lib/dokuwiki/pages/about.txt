The Bittrader analytics system is an alert and analytics system designed for individual traders and small proprietary shops. It consists of a web based system which can be uploaded to a cloud server, and is powered by the [[http://www.opengamma.com/|OpenGamma]] risks analytics engine, and [[http://www.r-project.org|R]] statistical project. Bitquant is developing this software to support its proprietary trading of bitcoin and bitcoin derivatives.

The system completely open source and is distributed as a disk image on sourceforge which can be run via VirtualBox or uploaded to a cloud server. The source code is BSD-licensed and completely available at Github. 

To check out our progress see the [[http://bitquant.wordpress.com|Bitquant blog]]

Our target date for alpha for an MVP (minimally viable product) is August 2014.
